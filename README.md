## What is glaive
Glaive lets you replay imageboard threads from any time. It reads from a SQL database using the `asagi` schema. 

It is still in development, so it is missing an easily reproducible development environment 
just yet. 

It is built with Go and React. 
It is currently deployed on Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Run, GCS and Cloud SQL.
